# CodeQuiz




- first I created 2 HTML sheets, 1 will contain the main content and quiz's questions and 1 for score.
- Second I created an css style sheet.
- Third I created 3 javascript sheets, first Questions.js to contain questions and answers, second logic.js for making the questions and answers works together and get next question after answering, third scores.js for the score.



- for the 1st sheet index.html, I linked it with css sheet, score.html, questions.js, and logic.js.
- index.html will contain a paragraph to explain the quiz and if you can take the quiz again. and also a "start quiz" button.
- once you press it the logic.js will go to work by showing you the quistions and choices from quistions.js.
- then it will show you your score and ask you for intials with a "submit" button.
- In Logic i also added some audio for the correct and incorrect answers.

- once you finish the quiz and see your score and clicked submit, it will take you to the score.html page.

- in score.html you will see details oon the score for each question and in the button it will ask you if you want to go back and retake quiz or clear score (delete all of it). and what will make the buttons work is the scores.js
